FLY-Fi

A commercial flight tracker. Personalized Arrival Board with notification via SMS.

We are providing an application that will track commercial flights, providing arrival time. A 
users can track specific flights, by entering flight number, and can receive notifications via SMS on when the flight is expected to arrive. 

What problems does this solve?
Getting picked up from the airport can be inconvenient - and expensive. 
Sometimes flights are delayed, parking is expensive, and public transport may not be desirable after a long flight. 
By watching real time flight data, you can predict when the flight will land, so that you can plan how long it takes to get to the airport from your house to meet someone.
People with an interest in aviation and planespotters can track the airplanes before landing.
If you need to meet with someone at the airport after they land for any reason, you will have a specific time.
Flights are sometimes delayed, updated flight data can reflect this.

# FLY - FI


hey man
honestly not difficult at all
what u do is u make a repo  one folder
inside the folder u run:
rails new backend
let that generate
and then after that u run
npx create-react-app frontend
and then u got 2 folders frontend and backend
after that is done gem install rack-cors and set it up like the docs tell u to and then u are done
the rest of it is just axios calls to the backend of rails and thats it :slightly_smiling_face:
